# GitHub Actions Setup Complete! 🎉

I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions setup for your RbxTrace project that will automatically handle releases and publishing to Wally. Here's what was created:

## 📁 Files Created

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

1. **`release.yml`** - Main release and Wally publishing workflow
2. **`ci.yml`** - Continuous integration and validation
3. **`pr-validation.yml`** - Pull request validation
4. **`update-docs.yml`** - Documentation updates after releases

### Templates (`.github/`)

1. **`README.md`** - Setup instructions and documentation
2. **`pull_request_template.md`** - PR template
3. **`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`** - Bug report template
4. **`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`** - Feature request template

## 🚀 Key Features

### Automatic Release System

- **Smart Version Bumping**: Automatically detects version bump type from commit messages
  - `feat:` → minor version bump
  - `fix:` → patch version bump
  - `breaking:` or `major:` → major version bump
- **Changelog Generation**: Auto-generates changelog entries
- **GitHub Releases**: Creates releases with built `.rbxm` files
- **Wally Publishing**: Automatically publishes to Wally registry

### Quality Assurance

- **Build Validation**: Ensures project builds successfully with Rojo
- **Dependency Checking**: Validates `wally.toml` format
- **Security Scanning**: Basic checks for secrets in code
- **PR Validation**: Validates pull request titles and changes

## 🛠️ Setup Required

### 1. Wally Authentication Token

**This is required for automatic publishing to Wally:**

1. Go to [Wally](https://wally.run/) and login
2. Generate an authentication token from your account settings
3. In your GitHub repository, go to:
   - **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Name: `WALLY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Wally auth token

### 2. Repository Settings

- Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in your repository settings
- Consider protecting the `main` branch to require PR reviews

## 📋 How It Works

### Automatic Releases (on push to main)

1. Detects changes to source files (`src/`, `wally.toml`, `default.project.json`)
2. Analyzes commit messages to determine version bump type
3. Updates version in `wally.toml`
4. Generates changelog entry
5. Builds project with Rojo
6. Publishes to Wally (if token is configured)
7. Creates GitHub release with assets
8. Tags the release

### Manual Releases

You can also trigger releases manually:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **"Release and Publish"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose version bump type (patch/minor/major)

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

For automatic version detection:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new logging feature"     # minor bump
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak"          # patch bump
git commit -m "feat!: breaking API change"        # major bump
git commit -m "docs: update README"               # patch bump
```

## 🎯 What Happens Next

1. **Next commit to main**: The workflow will trigger and create your first automated release
2. **Version will be bumped**: From current `0.0.1` to `0.0.2` (patch bump)
3. **Wally publish**: If you've added the auth token, it will publish automatically
4. **GitHub release**: A new release will be created with the built `.rbxm` file

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize the workflows by editing the files in `.github/workflows/`:

- Change version bump logic in `release.yml`
- Modify build process or add additional validation in `ci.yml`
- Adjust PR validation rules in `pr-validation.yml`

## 📚 Additional Features

- **Status Badges**: Added CI/CD and release status badges to your README
- **Documentation Updates**: Automatic version reference updates
- **Issue Templates**: Professional bug report and feature request templates
- **PR Templates**: Standardized pull request format

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your repository now has a professional-grade CI/CD pipeline that will:

- ✅ Automatically version and release your code
- ✅ Publish to Wally registry
- ✅ Create GitHub releases with assets
- ✅ Maintain changelogs
- ✅ Validate code quality
- ✅ Provide professional issue/PR templates

Just add your `WALLY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret and you're ready to go! 🚀
